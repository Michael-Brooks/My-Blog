## I'm Emmett Naughton, and my greatest strength is getting punched in the face repeatedly, and I continue to show up.

## Background

I am a Full Stack JavaScript Developer living in Upstate New York.
I have been building and creating online for the last three years, while working full time at my local hospital and raising my family. Its been a wild journey.
