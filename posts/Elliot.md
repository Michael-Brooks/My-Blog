I first heard about Elliot from the Co-Founder Sergio back in November of 2019!
We hopped on a call during my lunch break, and chatted about the platform and the vision.
There was an Emergency Care for Choking Sign behind me during the call, and that became a motto for Sergio.

## 6 Moonths Later!

Elliot is getting ready for a BIG Launch Day (JUNE 18, 2020), and since our call a lot has happened!
They brought on Marcos and Clayton as part of the Co-Founding Team.
Did I mention their logo is a cow?! Sergio picked a cow because it reminded him of his grandmother.
They have been heads down since, and building out their product to get ready for launch!
Of course they haven't had a clear path with COVID throwing a pretty big monkey wrench their way. But thats another stone in the field for the Cowverly.

## Virtual Mall

One of the coolest things the team has cooked up is the virtual mall. It was built in a GOOGLE SHEET! It has different floors, and even a food court! It showcases products from a number of DTC Brands. They have done at least three shopping sprees. Which includes a Zoom Call, and somebody "walking" through the mall and buying attendees products in the mall! Very fun and stress free to explore DTC. There are so many wonderful products showcased.

### Quick Review

Once you are logged in, you are brought to your own personal dashboard which has a sales graph, and some options to choose from on the left. It feels fresh, and easy to navigate options.
The coolest thing is this branded video. A fun way to annouce an launch day.
